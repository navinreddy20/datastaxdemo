# Getting Started with Apache Cassandraâ„¢ and Java using DataStax Astra DB
*50 minutes, Intermediate, [Start Building](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java#prerequisites)*

This provides an example REST backend built in Java using `Spring Boot` for use with the [Getting Started with Astra UI](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-ui).

## Objectives
* How to connect to Astra DB via the Secure Connect Bundle
* How to manage a Cassandra Session within a JAVA web application
  
## How this Works
This is an example of a Spring Boot Microservice for use with the Astra Getting Started UI which is found [here](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-ui).

## Get Started
To build and play with this app, follow the build instructions that are located here: [https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java#prerequisites)

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup by creating a serverless(!) database.

### DataStax Astra
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://dtsx.io/3zBltF7) if you don't already have one:

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Create Database`**

3. Locate the **`Get Started`** button to continue

4. Define a **database name**, **keyspace name** and select a database **region**, then click **create database**.

5. Your Astra DB will be ready when the status will change from *`Pending`* to **`Active`** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

6. After your database is provisioned, we need to generate an Application Token for our App. Go to the `Settings` tab in the database home screen.

7. Select `Admin User` for the role for this Sample App and then generate the token. Download the CSV so that we can use the credentials we need later.

8. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and select the driver connection that we need. Go ahead and download the `Secure Bundle` for the driver.

9. Make note of where to use the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` that is part of the Application Token that we generated earlier.

### Github
1. Click `Use this template` at the top of the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java):

2. Enter a repository name and click 'Create repository from template':

3. Clone the repository:

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Paths:
*Make sure you've completed the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) before starting this step*
  - [Running on your local machine](#running-on-your-local-machine)

### Running on your local machine
Make sure that you have:
* Java 11
* An Astra DB compatible Java driver, instructions may be found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudConnectJavaDriver.html) to install this locally.
* An Astra database with the CQL schema located in [schema.cql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java/master/src/main/resources/schema.cql) already added.
* The username, password, keyspace name, and secure connect bundle downloaded from your Astra DB.  For information on how to obtain these credentials please read the documentation found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudObtainingCredentials.html).

This application is a Spring Boot web application. This sample can be run from the root directory using:
```sh
cd getting-started-with-astra-java

mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will startup the application running on `http://localhost:8080`

You will know that you are up and working when you get the following in your terminal window:
```sh
16:23:01.569 INFO  com.datastax.astra.GettingStartedWithAstra  : Started GettingStartedWithAstra in 1.851 seconds (JVM running for 2.39)
```

#### Access the API documentation from a browser

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

*Note: If you want to change the listening port of the application, locate the file `src/main/resources/application.yml` and change key `server.port`*

#### Setup the user interface to use this backend
To setup the UI to connect to Java backend define a `.env` file in the `getting-started-with-astra-ui` project main directory. Inside the file it should have one entry pointing to this project's API endpoint:
```sh
BASE_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8080/api
```
Once you start that project with a `npm run build` it will point the UI to the backend API which will then be using Astra DB as a database. When you first connect to the UI, a dialog box will open asking for Astra DB connection information.
